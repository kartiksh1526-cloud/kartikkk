# DocuShieldAI / VerifyFlow

SIH26188-ready document verification platform with a modular vanilla frontend and Express backend. The app handles private uploads, SQLite metadata, SHA-256 hashes, administrator access, audit records, and an adapter for an authorized verification provider.

## Architecture

The root is intentionally split into `client/`, `server/`, `tests/`, and `docs/`. Frontend pages and assets live in `client/`. Backend routes, controllers, services, models, middleware, providers, and database schema live in `server/`. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm
- An authorized verification-provider account for automated authenticity checks
- Tesseract.js OCR is included for image text extraction; PDF OCR requires a separate PDF-to-image pipeline.

## Install and run

```powershell
npm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) for the SIH26188 product landing page. Start the applicant flow from there; it continues to `applicant.html`, `documents.html`, and `verification.html`.

## Publish publicly with Render

This project includes [render.yaml](render.yaml). GitHub Pages cannot run the Express API, SQLite database, OCR worker, or protected document endpoints, so deploy the full service to Render:

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In Render, choose **New > Blueprint** and select `aryan4399-n/DocuShield-AI`.
3. Confirm the `render.yaml` blueprint and create the service.
4. Render generates `ADMIN_TOKEN` automatically and provisions a persistent disk for SQLite and private uploads.
5. The application uses local/manual document review and does not require an external verification API.
6. Open the generated `https://docushieldai-sih26188.onrender.com/` URL.

The deployed health check is `https://docushieldai-sih26188.onrender.com/api/health`. The exact hostname may differ if Render changes the service name; use the URL shown in the Render dashboard. Do not use the local `.env` token in a public deployment.

Set a long random `ADMIN_TOKEN` in `.env`. The admin page asks for this token in the browser and keeps it only in the current session. The development fallback token in the checked-out `.env` must be replaced before use beyond local testing.

## OCR

Tesseract.js is installed with the backend and runs in `server/services/ocr.service.js`. It reuses one worker for image documents and terminates only when the server process is shut down. OCR output is not stored because document text may contain sensitive personal information; only OCR availability, pass state, and text length are recorded in verification checks. OCR is not document authenticity verification.

## API

- `GET /api/health`
- `POST /api/applications/submit` multipart form with `applicant` JSON and document fields `governmentId`, `addressProof`, `panCard`, `photo`, `supporting`, plus optional fields
- `GET /api/applications/:applicationId`
- `GET /api/admin/applications` with `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>`
- `GET /api/admin/applications/:id` with admin authentication
- `POST /api/admin/applications/:id/review` with admin authentication and `{ "status": "verified|manual_review|failed", "message": "..." }`
- `GET /api/admin/applications/:id/documents/:documentId/file` with admin authentication
- `GET /api/admin/audit-logs` with admin authentication

Allowed files are PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, DOC, DOCX, and WEBP for photographs. Each file is limited to 10 MB by default. Uploads are stored outside the public directory with random names; only database metadata is returned to applicants.

## Tests

Run `npm test` for the Node test suite. Add route-level integration tests with the preferred HTTP test runner when dependencies are installed in the deployment environment.

## Production requirements

Replace the development token prompt with a real login system using hashed passwords, sessions or short-lived JWTs, role-based access control, HTTPS, CSRF protection where applicable, stricter CORS, audit logs, provider webhooks/signature validation, malware scanning, durable private object storage, backups, and a production database. Rotate all development secrets and do not commit `.env`, `uploads/`, or the SQLite database.
